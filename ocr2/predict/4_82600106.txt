My friend is Lily. She is thirteen years old. She is from England. She study in
Beijing now. We are in the same class. Her favourite subject is Music. She is very good
at Maths, too. She often help me with my English, and I often help her with her
Chinese. After school, we often play together. She likes China very much.
