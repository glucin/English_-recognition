Dear Mark,
something.
How is it going? I'm writing to tell you about my good friend.
I have a good friend. She is Liy. She is thirteen years old. She is very
kind and nice. She is good at English. And she doesn't like sports.
Her favourite subjects ane English and music. Her favourite
colour is blue. Her favourite animal is cat. He often helps me
with my English, and I often help her with her Chinese. I like her?
 to me soon
