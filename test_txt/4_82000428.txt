How are you? I'm writing to tell you something about my good friend
Look, this is my good friend Andy. She is very kind.  She is a
girl. She is 12 years old. She likes playing computer games. Her favourite subject
is English, but, her English isn't good. She is good at sports. she often play basketball in the
Sunday. She is a good girl
This is friend. How about you
